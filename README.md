# chaos_js_translate
A translator that works off Grease/TamperMonkey to translate Chaos Cards

If you're on FireFox => install [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
If you're on Chrome => install [TamplerMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

To install, copy and paste app.js in to a new userscript and hit save.

Updating the application and updating the rules list are currently WIP.
